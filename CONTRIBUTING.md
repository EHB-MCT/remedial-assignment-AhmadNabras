## ðŸŒ± Branch Workflow

We use a feature-branch workflow:

- **main** â†’ stable branch (production-ready code)
- **feat/random-seed-depletion** â†’ random resource consumption logic
- **feat/seed-colonies** â†’ initial seeding and colony creation
- **feat/analytics** â†’ backend-powered analytics and history tracking (already merged into `main`)

When starting new features, always create a branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature
